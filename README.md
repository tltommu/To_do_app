| A (Did action) | E (Evidence exists) | Assumption (They are a killer?) | Can we prove?                    | Is Evidence Possible?                       | Conclusion (Judged as...) | Outcome Correct?      | Notes                                                           |

| True           | True                | True                            | ✅ Yes — evidence supports action | ✅ Yes — action occurred                     | Judged as guilty          | ✅ Correct             | Ideal — action happened, evidence found, assumption correct.    |

| True           | False               | True                            | ❌ No — evidence lacking          | ✅ Yes — action occurred                     | Judged as guilty          | ✅ Correct (but risky) | Judged guilty without evidence — outcome right, process flawed. |
