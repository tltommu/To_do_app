| A (Did action) | E (Evidence exists)   | Assumption (They are a killer?) | Can we prove?                          | Conclusion (Judged as...)            | Outcome Correct?      | Notes                                                                 |

| True           | True                  | No                              | ✅ Yes — evidence supports action       | Rightly judged guilty                | ✅ Correct             | Evidence exists, so judged guilty despite incorrect assumption.       |

| False          | True *(not possible)* | No                              | ❌ No — no valid evidence possible      | Rightly judged innocent              | ✅ Correct             | No action, so no valid evidence — judgment correct despite confusion. |
| False          | False                 | Yes                             | ❌ No — no evidence exists or can exist | Wrongly judged guilty                | ❌ Incorrect           | Core danger: guilt assumed without action or evidence.                |
