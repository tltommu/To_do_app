Evidence exists if and only if the action occurred.

This is the logical biconditional:

𝐸
⇔
𝐴
E⇔A
Let:

𝐴
A: Action (e.g. the murder) occurred

𝐵
B: Direct evidence of 
𝐴
A

𝐶
C: Destruction of 
𝐵
B

𝐷
D: Evidence of 
𝐶
C

So:

𝐴
⇒
𝐵
𝐵
⇒
¬
𝐶
∨
𝐷
∴
𝐴
⇒
(
𝐵
∨
𝐷
)
A⇒B
B⇒¬C∨D
∴A⇒(B∨D)
Which means:
If an action occurred, there will always exist some observable consequence — either direct evidence 
𝐵
B, or evidence of tampering 
𝐷
D.

Therefore, evidence is a perfect reflection of whether the action occurred (no false positives or false negatives)



| A | E | K | Can we Prove?                 | Conclusion      | Correct? | Notes                                                            |
| - | - | - | ----------------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | ✅ Yes — evidence confirms act | Judged guilty   | ✅ Yes    | Ideal case. Action occurred, evidence found, correct assumption. |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ Yes — evidence confirms act | Judged guilty   | ✅ Yes    | Evidence overrides false assumption — judgment still correct.    |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | ❌ No — no evidence            | Judged guilty   | ❌ No     | Wrong assumption. No action, no evidence — unfair prosecution.   |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | ❌ No — no evidence            | Judged innocent | ✅ Yes    | No action, no evidence, and assumed innocent — perfect judgment. |
