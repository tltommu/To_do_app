Evidence exists if and only if the action occurred.

This is the logical biconditional:

𝐸
⇔
𝐴
E⇔A
🧠 Interpretation:
If someone did kill → evidence must exist (at some point even when it is destroyed; let say A is the event of the murder and B is the evidence of A. C is the event of destorying B, D as the evidence of C must exist)

If someone did not kill → evidence cannot exist

Therefore, evidence is a perfect reflection of whether the action occurred (no false positives or false negatives)



| A | E | K | Can we Prove?                 | Conclusion      | Correct? | Notes                                                            |
| - | - | - | ----------------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | ✅ Yes — evidence confirms act | Judged guilty   | ✅ Yes    | Ideal case. Action occurred, evidence found, correct assumption. |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ Yes — evidence confirms act | Judged guilty   | ✅ Yes    | Evidence overrides false assumption — judgment still correct.    |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | ❌ No — no evidence            | Judged guilty   | ❌ No     | Wrong assumption. No action, no evidence — unfair prosecution.   |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | ❌ No — no evidence            | Judged innocent | ✅ Yes    | No action, no evidence, and assumed innocent — perfect judgment. |
