## Generalized Definition of A

𝐴: An intentional event caused by an agent that necessarily produces observable consequences in the real world.

More formally:

𝐴= An agent-driven action or event that leaves causal traces (evidence) in the environment
A=An agent-driven action or event that leaves causal traces (evidence) in the environment
This could include:

Physical acts (e.g., committing a murder, writing a document, stealing an object)

Digital actions (e.g., sending a message, deleting a file, making a transaction)

Social or legal events (e.g., making a promise, signing a contract, violating a rule)

## 🧠 Philosophical Framing
This aligns with causal realism and event ontology, where:

Events are real, spatiotemporal occurrences

Events cause changes in the world

All changes leave detectable traces (unless counteracted by further causality)

Evidence exists if and only if the action occurred.

| $A$    | The **cause event** or **primary action**                                        |
| $E$    | **Evidence** — observable consequences of $A$                                    |
| $K$    | **Assumption/judgment** — whether the observer believes $A$ occurred             |
| $C$    | Event of **concealment/destruction** of evidence                                 |
| $D$    | **Meta-evidence** — consequences of $C$, proving that evidence was tampered with |



This is the logical biconditional:

𝐸
⇔
𝐴
E⇔A
Let:

𝐴: Action (e.g. the murder) occurred

𝐵: Direct evidence of 𝐴

𝐶: Destruction of 𝐵

𝐷: Evidence of C

So:

𝐴
⇒
𝐵
𝐵
⇒
¬
𝐶
∨
𝐷
∴
𝐴
⇒
(
𝐵
∨
𝐷
)
A⇒B
B⇒¬C∨D
∴A⇒(B∨D)
Which means:
If an action occurred, there will always exist some observable consequence — either direct evidence 
𝐵, or evidence of tampering 
𝐷.

Therefore, evidence is a perfect reflection of whether the action occurred (no false positives or false negatives)

| 1 | 1 | 1 | ✅ Yes — evidence confirms act | Judged guilty   | ✅ Yes    | Ideal case. Action occurred, evidence found, correct assumption. |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ Yes — evidence confirms act | Judged guilty   | ✅ Yes    | Evidence overrides false assumption — judgment still correct.    |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | ❌ No — no evidence            | Judged guilty   | ❌ No     | Wrong assumption. No action, no evidence — unfair prosecution.   |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | ❌ No — no evidence            | Judged innocent | ✅ Yes    | No action, no evidence, and assumed innocent — perfect judgment. |
